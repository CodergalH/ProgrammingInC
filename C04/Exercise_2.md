**Which of the following are invalid variable names? Why?**

```
Int             char    6_05
Calloc          Xx      alpha_beta_routine
floating        _1312   z
ReInitialize    _       A$
```

**Solutions**

> char - Reserved word
> 6_05 - Variable name cannot start with interger
> A$ - $ not allowed
