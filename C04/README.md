```
123.456         0x10.5      0X0G1
0001            0xFFFF      123L
0Xab05          0L          -597.25
123.5e2         .0001       +12
98.6F           98.7U       17777s
0996            -12E-12     07777
1234uL          1.2Fe-7     15,000
1.234L          197u        100U
0XABCDEFL       0xabcu      +123
```


### [Exercise_4](./Exercise_4.c)

**Write a program that converts 27Â° from degrees Fahrenheit (F) to degrees Celsius (C) using the following formula:**

```
C = (F - 32) / 1.8
```


### [Exercise_5](./Exercise_5.md)

**What output would you expect from the following program?**

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
    char c, d;

    c = 'd';
    d = c;
    printf ("d = %c\n", d);
    return 0;
}
```


### [Exercise_6](./Exercise_6.c)

**Write a program to evaluate the polynomial shown here:**
```
3x<sup>3</sup> - 5x<sup>2</sup> + 6
```
**for x = 2.55**


### [Exercise_7](./Exercise_7.c)

**Write a program that evaluates the following expression and displays the results (remember to use exponential format to display the result):**

```
(3.31 x 10-8 x 2.01 x 10-7) / (7.16 x 10-6 + 2.01 x 10-8)
```

### [Exercise_8](./Exercise_8.c)

**To round off an integer i to the next largest even multiple of another integer j, the following formula can be used:**
> Next_multiple = i + j - i % j

**For example, to round off 256 days to the next largest number of days evenly divisible by a week, values of i = 256 and j = 7 can be substituted into the preceding formula as follows:**
> Next_multiple = 256 + 7 - 256 % 7
>               = 256 + 7 - 4
>               = 25

**Write a program to find the next largest even multiple for the following values of i and j:**
> i         j
> 365       7
> 12,258    23
> 996       4
